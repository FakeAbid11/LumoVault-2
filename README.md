# LumoVault

A private Android photo, video and GIF library with cloud backup powered by the user's own
Telegram account. Your photos. Your storage.

[`prd.md`](prd.md) is the master specification and the source of truth for every product decision.
This README records build and architecture status only.

## Status

**Phase 1 — foundation:** complete, verified green (run
[36024569535](https://github.com/FakeAbid11/LumoVault-2/actions/runs/36024569535)).

**Phase 2 — onboarding + Telegram authentication:** complete, verified green (run
[36038113299](https://github.com/FakeAbid11/LumoVault-2/actions/runs/36038113299)). The six
onboarding screens, the searchable country selector, E.164 phone normalization, the authentication
state machine, its nine human-readable failures, persisted setup choices, and launch gating are
built and compiling; live Telegram sign-in is not (see *Telegram status*).

**Phase 3 — local photo library:** complete, verified green (run
[36046308629](https://github.com/FakeAbid11/LumoVault-2/actions/runs/36046308629), 69 unit tests,
17.1 MB debug APK published as an artifact).

- A MediaStore scanner that indexes photos, videos and GIFs from metadata only — it never opens file
  bytes, and it identifies GIFs by MIME type rather than treating every image as static
- A Room `media` table carrying the columns PRD section 61 names, indexes chosen for the two queries
  the timeline actually runs, and a v2→v3 migration
- Incremental sync: rows are tagged with a scan id, upserted in chunks, and rows the scan did not see
  are removed — no rebuild, and no `NOT IN (…)` list a large library would overflow
- The Photos screen: day-grouped lazy grid, windowed loading instead of one in-memory list, Coil
  thumbnails decoded to the cell's size, video play/duration and GIF badges
- One sealed `PhotosUiState`, so "this device has no media" and "the index is not built yet" cannot
  be confused; permission, scanning, empty, error and pull-to-refresh states
- The Phase 2 folder picker now lists real folders from the index instead of an empty state

**Still not built, by design:** Telegram upload, the backup queue, hashing, the remote manifest,
channel discovery and the Cloud library, restore, free-up-space, map, albums, trash and Settings.
Phase 3 is entirely local — nothing leaves the device.

## Build in the cloud — never locally

The development machine is not expected to compile Android. Do not run `gradlew assembleDebug`,
`gradlew build`, `gradlew test`, or an Android Studio build locally.

```
commit + push  →  GitHub Actions  →  assembleDebug + testDebugUnitTest  →  LumoVault-debug-apk
```

`.github/workflows/build.yml` installs SDK platform 37, assembles the debug APK and runs the JVM
unit tests, then uploads `app-debug.apk` as an artifact (30 days). Download it from the run's
**Artifacts** section. A workflow run that has not gone green is not a build.

Phases 2 and 3 did not change the workflow: nothing new needs a CI-side tool.

### Telegram credentials

`app/build.gradle.kts` reads two build inputs and exposes them through `BuildConfig`:

| Source | Property | Secret |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gradle property or env var | `TELEGRAM_API_ID` | `TELEGRAM_API_ID` |
| Gradle property or env var | `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` | `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` |

Both default to absent, which is a supported state: the app reports
`TelegramAuthState.NotConfigured` and the onboarding screen explains it. No credential, phone
number, code, password or session value is committed, hardcoded, or logged. The api hash is
filtered to hex before it reaches generated source, so a stray quote cannot break the build and a
value cannot inject code.

To build a signed-in-capable APK once the binary lands:

```
-PPTELEGRAM_API_ID=... -PTELEGRAM_API_HASH=...
```

## Telegram status — what is real and what is deferred

The client is TDLib, behind interfaces, over TDLib's **own Java binding** rather than its JSON one:

```
Kotlin → TelegramClient → org.drinkless.tdlib.Client → org.drinkless.tdlib.TdApi → libtdjni.so → Telegram
```

Already implemented and unit-tested off-device: the authorization-state mapping, error mapping
including `FLOOD_WAIT_<n>`, the cloud message mapper, the channel-marker rules, and the flow rules
that decide which screen appears. The fakes build real `TdApi` objects, because those are plain data
until a request is actually sent — so the mapping is tested against the same classes production uses,
not against a stand-in grammar.

**The remaining seam is the native binary.** `libtdjni.so` and the generated `Client.java` /
`TdApi.java` come from [`build-tdlib.yml`](.github/workflows/build-tdlib.yml), which runs TDLib's own
`example/android` Docker build at a pinned revision; [`build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml)
downloads them and verifies each file against a pinned SHA-256 before it assembles. Until that
workflow has produced a run this build can point at, `isUsable` is false, authentication is honestly
reported as unavailable, and **Phase 2's acceptance criterion "Telegram authentication works" is not
met by this commit**. The Ready screen shows Telegram as *Unavailable* rather than ticking it, and no
screen pretends otherwise.

Because the API is generated from TDLib's scheme, every request and field name here was read out of
`td/generate/scheme/td_api.tl` at the pinned revision `ea97bcd`, and the generated Java's naming came
from `td/generate/tl_writer_java.cpp` — class names are the TL constructor with a capital first letter
and field names are camelCase, so `authorizationStateWaitCode.code_info` is
`TdApi.AuthorizationStateWaitCode.codeInfo`. That is also what corrected three earlier guesses: the
phone-code request is `setAuthenticationPhoneNumber` (with a `PhoneNumberAuthenticationSettings`
object), `setTdlibParameters` takes its fields flat rather than as a nested `tdlib_parameters` object,
and the code length arrives as `codeInfo.type.length` rather than a separate `codeLength`. When the
pin moves, re-check them against that revision; a renamed field is now a compile error rather than a
login that silently never finishes.

## Toolchain

| Component | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Android Gradle Plugin | 9.4.1 |
| Gradle | 9.7.1 (wrapper jar checksum-pinned) |
| Kotlin | 2.3.21 (AGP 9 built-in Kotlin; no `kotlin-android` plugin) |
| KSP | 2.3.12 |
| Compose BOM | 2026.09.00 (Material 3) |
| Room | 2.8.5 |
| libphonenumber | 9.0.40 |
| Coil | 3.6.3 (`coil-compose`, `coil-video`; no network artifact) |
| TDLib | pinned revision `ea97bcd`, Java interface (`libtdjni.so`) |
| compileSdk / targetSdk / minSdk | 37 / 37 / 26 |

Versions live in [`gradle/libs.versions.toml`](gradle/libs.versions.toml). Kotlin stays on the 2.3
line because KSP has no 2.4.x release; moving Kotlin first would break Room's annotation processing.

Two dependencies were added deliberately, each for a job that hand-rolling would do worse:
libphonenumber (calling codes, example numbers, E.164 parsing) and Coil (thumbnail decode and cache
for `content://` URIs). TDLib contributes no dependency at all: its generated Java sources and its
`libtdjni.so` are build inputs fetched by CI, not artifacts resolved from a repository.

```

Composables never touch a database, network or file storage; the Activity only hosts Compose; and
each screen reads one immutable UI state. Room owns all persisted state — there is no second
preference mechanism. `domain/usecase/` remains absent on purpose: nothing yet needs logic spanning
two repositories, and a pass-through wrapper would only add a hop.

Decisions worth knowing about:

- **One settings row, one writer.** `AppSettingsStore` performs every change as a
  read-modify-write inside a transaction, so the theme toggle and the onboarding flow sharing one
  row cannot overwrite each other.
- **Room v2.** Phase 1 shipped a v1 the first cloud build rejected (an entity-free `@Database` is
  illegal), so PRD section 61's `UserSettings` row became the first entity, and Phase 2's fields are
  an explicit `MIGRATION_1_2`.
- **Permission state is read live, decisions are stored.** A remembered "granted" would be wrong the
  moment the user revokes access in system settings.
- **The country list is derived, not bundled.** `Locale.getISOCountries()` for names,
  libphonenumber for calling codes, emoji flags from the ISO code — no dataset to rot, no bitmaps.
- **DI is still a hand-written container.** Hilt earns its place when Phase 5's WorkManager workers
  need constructor injection across processes.

## Validation performed

Static checks locally: package declarations against paths, every `com.lumovault.app.*` import
against an actual declaration, all `R.string` references against `strings.xml` (and the reverse, for
orphans), catalog accessors against build scripts, XML/YAML parsing, brace balance, unused imports.
Android compilation happens only in GitHub Actions — and Phase 1 proved that this is where the
real mistakes get caught.
